Hello,

this is the code used for my MSc thesis.
It's a bit old, and I don't know whether it is the last and working version (I have a lot of mess in my saved files)
If you want more material, just drop me a couple of lines and I will send you the presentation which describes 
the algorithm plus some other files.

Enjoy
